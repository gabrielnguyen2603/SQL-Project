# SQL-Project
The World Bank's IDA (International Development Association) Statement of Credits, Grants and Guarantees dataset provides a comprehensive view of financial assistance provided to developing countries. This dataset contains over 300MB of historical data covering all credits, grants, and guarantees provided since inception, with monthly snapshots from April 2011 onward.

The primary purpose of creating an SQL project with this dataset is to analyze global development financing patterns and provide insights into how the World Bank supports poverty reduction efforts worldwide. The IDA provides development credits, grants and guarantees to recipient member countries at concessional rates to help meet their development needs
