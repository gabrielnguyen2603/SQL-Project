# The World Bank Financial Analysis
The World Bank's IDA (International Development Association) Statement of Credits, Grants and Guarantees dataset provides a comprehensive view of financial assistance provided to developing countries. This dataset contains over 300MB of historical data covering all credits, grants, and guarantees provided since inception, with monthly snapshots from April 2011 to May 2025.

The primary purpose of creating an SQL project with this dataset is to analyze global development financing patterns and provide insights into how the World Bank supports poverty reduction efforts worldwide. The IDA provides development credits, grants and guarantees to recipient member countries at concessional rates to help meet their development needs

# Exploration 
For this project, I first use Python to preprocess the dataset, converting data types (such as dates and numeric fields) to ensure consistency and accuracy. I also rename features to more descriptive and standardized names for clarity and easier analysis. After cleaning and transforming the data, I load it into a MySQL database. MySQL is then used for structured querying and in-depth data analysis, allowing me to efficiently answer key business questions and uncover trends within the IDA funding dataset
